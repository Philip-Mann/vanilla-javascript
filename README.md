### We were introduced to the DOM and coded a mock travel app using Javascript and styled our app with CSS.
### As a beginner I was terrified of the thought of using Javascript to create an HTML document however I had a blast building it!
### Javascript is the most challenging thing about my coding bootcamp and this helped me realize that Javascript isn't that scary.
